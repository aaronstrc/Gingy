- level one objective-


The object of the first level is to find a key somewhere in the level and unlock the door above the refrigerator to fight the boss.  

BOSS 1 - AntiGingy

The boss for the first level is an antiGingerbread man.  The boss has two types of attacks punching and throwing a ball. To kill the boss requires a hit count of 25.  When you defeat the boss a flag appears to go to the main lobby of the game.

BOSS 2 - Big Bad Wolf

Temporarily have added the second boss for the red riding hood level.  The current setup is like the first level.  The user must find a key then unlock a door to go to the boss. I would like more creative ideas for levels.  The level for now is just testing.

	-Main Lobby-
The main lobby is a library that has books that transports your character to different levels.
